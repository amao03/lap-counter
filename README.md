# Lap Counter
## Overview
This project aims to create a lap counter to count the laps of a swimmer in the pool. This is a personal project with Dante Cannarozzi who is a recreational swimmer and WashU alum. 
## Project Requirements
A minimum viable project will be able to accurately count how many laps someone swims in the pool from a video. We would also like to investigate some of these additional features depending on time: 
<ol>
  <li>Tracking multiple swimmers at once</li>
  <li>Timing splits</li>
  <li>Detecting which stroke the swimmer is performing</li>
  <li>Tracking the swimmer live, as opposed to from a video</li>
  <li>Supporting multiple cameras to improve tracking quality</li>
</ol>

## Technology required
We plan to use the python package openCV to do object tracking, Github to manage the codebase, Google Drive to collect videos and notes, and cameras to record videos.

## Testing
We will ask others to record swimming videos and we will verify that the lap counter works correctly. 

## Timeline
<ul>
  <li>9/20-10/4: This will be the experimentation phase. We will look at different camera angles and video processing, such as cropping and background subtraction. We will also try different tracking algorithms, such as tracking by cap color, tracking by the swimmers themselves or by water splashing.</li>
  <li>10/18: We have an MVP which is able to count the laps of a swimmer from a video.</li>
  <li>11/1: We have an additional feature implemented.</li>
  <li>11/15: We have built an interface so other users can track their laps.</li>
  <li>12/2: We have some buffer time to continue on previous phases or add another feature.</li>
  <li>12/2- 12/6: Work on Final Presentation and Present</li>
</ul>

## Semester plan
Listed in GitHub issues

## How it will be shared
We will share it over Github and hopefully have a shareable interface.
